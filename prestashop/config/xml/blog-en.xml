				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>Today Leah Hamilton from Terms Feed gives us the low-down on how to avoid spamming customers during the holiday season.</em></p>
<p>At holiday time, when you’re sending out mailers, special deals, and seasonal sales, the name of the game is to market your product, and market hard. The winter holidays are the biggest spending season of the year, and it’s highly likely that <a href="http://www.marketingcharts.com/online/marketers-continue-to-rate-email-the-most-effective-digital-marketing-tactic-46295/" target="_blank">email marketing </a>will be one of your primary methods of reaching your customers. Given the crucial importance of marketing at this time, it’s important to remember to comply with anti-spam legislation when you carry out your marketing plan.</p>
<p>First we’ll take a look at why Christmas and holiday-season marketing is so important for your business, then look at how to make sure you get it right, legally.<br />
<span id="more-20950"></span></p>
<h2 style="color: #5c69af">Marketing in the Holiday Season</h2>
<p>The winter holiday season is definitely the most lucrative of the year; and it’s not just Christmas, either: more than 90 percent of Americans celebrated Christmas, Kwanza or Hanukah in 2014, and spent an <a href="http://research.nrffoundation.com/Default.aspx?pg=9003#.U2E-1_ldVyw" target="_blank">average of $730</a> on gifts, food, and decorations. Check out the graph from the National Retail Federation that shows just how far ahead the winter holidays are:</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-20952" alt="holiday-spending-totals" src="https://www.prestashop.com/blog/en/files/2015/12/holiday-spending-totals.png" width="674" height="573" /></p>
<p><em style="font-size: 13px">Image: NRF Consumer Holiday Spending USA (<a href="https://nrf.com/news/the-long-and-short-of-americas-consumer-holidays" target="_blank">https://nrf.com/news/the-long-and-short-of-americas-consumer-holidays</a>)</em></p>
<p>It’s easy to see why merchants ramp up their marketing efforts this time of year: everyone is on the lookout for gifts for friends and family, special deals and themed products. Marketers need to capitalize on this opportunity by sending out their latest specials, catalogues and holiday-themed emails. Given the importance of the holiday season to many people, getting it right means an opportunity to build customer loyalty and a chance to capitalize on goodwill.</p>
<p>However, it’s important to make sure that holiday marketing is done right. Here’s where CAN-SPAM and other pieces of anti-spam law come in. First let’s take a look at the anti-spam legislation in the US, as well as the UK and Europe, and then we’ll look at some holiday examples of how to comply.</p>
<h2 style="color: #5c69af">What Are the Key Pieces of Anti-Spam Legislation?</h2>
<h4>Anti-Spam in Europe and the UK</h4>
<p>In Europe, anti-spam rules are covered by the <a href="http://www.email-marketing-reports.com/canspam/eu/" target="_blank">Privacy and Electronic Communication Directive</a>, issued in 2002. EU Member States are expected to implement this Directive in their own local laws. The UK has done this by way of the <a href="https://ico.org.uk/for-the-public/online/spam-emails/" target="_blank">Privacy and Electronic Communications (EC Directive) Regulations 2003</a>, which sets out a number of rules that must be followed when sending out marketing emails.</p>
<p>First, to email or market to someone who isn’t already a customer, you must offer them a chance to <a href="https://termsfeed.com/blog/legal-mistakes-uk-email-marketing/" target="_blank">opt in explicitly</a>. Here’s an example of what an explicit opt-in looks like:</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-20953" alt="join-our-mailing-list" src="https://www.prestashop.com/blog/en/files/2015/12/join-our-mailing-list.png" width="880" height="603" /></p>
<p><em>Image: <a href="https://www.katespade.com/katespade-customer-service-your-account/join-mailing-list.html" target="_blank">Kate Spade Mailing List</a></em></p>
<p>You can see in the image above that Kate Spade asks for an email address and for the user to click a “Join” button before product announcements, promotions or sales reminders are sent to the customer. They also include a link to their privacy policy and terms of use, which is good practice.</p>
<p>UK anti-spam law also allows something called a <a href="http://www.lawdonut.co.uk/law/sales-and-marketing/marketing-and-advertising/your-email-marketing-and-anti-spam-law" target="_blank">soft opt-in</a>. This soft opt-in allows you to treat a customer as if they have consented to receiving emails from you, even though they actually haven’t. To comply with the soft opt-in allowance you need to:</p>
<ul style="padding-left: 30px">
<li>Have <strong>obtained the customer’s email address “in the course of the sale of negotiations for the sale of a product or service.”</strong> This means that the person has to be already a customer, and you can’t just email random people.</li>
<li><strong>Only email those people in relation to “similar products and services.”</strong> So if your customers signed up to receive jewellery newsletters from you, you can’t send them advertisements for gardening supplies.</li>
<li><strong>Give the person a method of refusing the use of his or her contact details</strong> at the time they initially provide them.</li>
</ul>
<p>Like US law (which we’ll discuss below) UK law also requires that you give your customers an opportunity to opt-out of emails that you send them. The option to unsubscribe must be <strong>easily visible, and displayed on every email</strong>.</p>
<h4>CAN-SPAM and the US</h4>
<p>In the US, the primary governing law is CAN-SPAM. CAN-SPAM stands for <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/tips-advice/business-center/guidance/can-spam-act-compliance-guide-business" target="_blank">Controlling the Assault of Non-Solicited Pornography And Marketing Act of 2003</a>, and it is a piece of legislation that sets the rules for commercial emails, such as holiday advertisements.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/tips-advice/business-center/guidance/can-spam-act-compliance-guide-business" target="_blank">main requirements of CAN-SPAM</a> are:</p>
<ul style="padding-left: 30px">
<li>Don’t use misleading header information in your emails. For instance, don’t change your “From” text to say that your name is “National Hospital” when it (clearly) isn’t. Your email address and domain name should be accurate.</li>
<li>Don’t use deceptive subject lines. Don’t use “Fwd:” or “Re:” in your email header just to make it look more like your recipient has already contacted you. Or alternatively, if your email is a marketing email about your product, don’t make your subject line “URGENT: Mom ill!” Your subject line should accurately reflect the contact of your email.</li>
<li>If you are sending marketing messages, you must identify your message as an advertisement in some way.</li>
<li>You must notify your recipients of where you are located. In particular, you must provide a valid physical postal address (e.g. street address, PO box, private mailbox).</li>
<li>Include opt-out information for your recipients.</li>
<li>Honor any opt-out requests. You must do this within 10 business days, and there must not be a fee for your recipient to opt out.</li>
<li>If someone else is sending marketing emails on your behalf, you must monitor what they are doing and ensure that they comply with the law.</li>
</ul>
<p>This law is enforced by the Federal Trade Commission (<strong>FTC</strong>), and if a person or organisation does not comply, they may be subject to <a href="https://sendgrid.com/blog/can-spam-compliance-breaking/" target="_blank">penalties of up to ,000</a> for each email in violation. Both the company whose product is promoted in the message, and the company who sent the message may be legally responsible.</p>
<h2 style="color: #5c69af">How to comply</h2>
<p>Let’s take a look at some examples of Christmas mailers that comply with the laws above.</p>
<p>Here’s an example from <a href="http://www.pumpkinpatch.co.nz/" target="_blank">Pumpkin Patch</a> kidswear that shows the unsubscribe link at the bottom of the email:</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-20951" alt="pumpkin-patch" src="https://www.prestashop.com/blog/en/files/2015/12/pumpkin-patch.png" width="525" height="507" /></p>
<p>You can see that Pumpkin Patch has a link to what is essentially a preferences page, where the email recipient can change their account preferences and unsubscribe from email advertisements. It’s ok to either provide a direct unsubscribe link, or send your customers to their preferences page to do so, as Pumpkin Patch has done.</p>
<p>Next let’s take a look at an example from <a href="http://www.bhcosmetics.com/" target="_blank">BH Cosmetics</a>. In the example below you can see that BH Cosmetics has included their physical address to notify recipients of their location.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-20954" alt="last-day-to-ship" src="https://www.prestashop.com/blog/en/files/2015/12/last-day-to-ship.png" width="722" height="446" /></p>
<p>Finally, the last example from the <a href="https://www.portablenorthpole.com/en/" target="_blank">Portable North Pole</a> shows appropriate headers and subject lines, as well as clearly indicating that the email is an advertisement.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-20955" alt="newsletter-santa" src="https://www.prestashop.com/blog/en/files/2015/12/newsletter-santa-1024x719.png" width="700" height="491" /></p>
<p>You can see that the subject line, the email “from” field, and email address are all correct and honest about who the email is coming from (Portable North Pole). In the message itself, the wording “fan offer” and “get your unlimited pass and enjoy Premium video messages” clearly indicate that this is an advertisement for customers to purchase a Premium video package as opposed to the free video messages that Portable North Pole offers.</p>
<h2 style="color: #5c69af">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Advertising in the holiday season is a great way to reach your customers and get them hooked on holiday deals, but make sure to comply with anti-spam laws in your country when you email them! By including an unsubscribe link in your emails, and staying honest and truthful in all communications, you’ll be well on your way to meeting the anti-spam requirements you’ll be subject to.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Did you crush your holiday sales this year? With 2015 rolling to a close, it’s already time to start planning for 2016. Have you considered expanding your audience beyond your borders to reach more potential customers? We’re helping you do just that with 3 ways to expand your business internationally in 2016.<br />
<span id="more-20942"></span></p>
<h2 style="color:#01bad9">1. Set up a multi-currency payment provider</h2>
<p>The first tool you’ll need to expand your business internationally is a payment provider that allows you to accept different currencies and process multiple payment options. Visa, MasterCard, Amex, Diners, JCB, Discover and PayPal are just a few of the popular payment options customers prefer. Next, it’s important to offer new or potential customers their preferred currency because not only are they more familiar with it, they incur fewer to no fees when they complete translations. </p>
<p><a href="http://addons.prestashop.com/en/payments-gateways-prestashop-modules/18752-brinkscheckout.html" target="_blank">Brinks Checkout</a> is one of the <a href="http://addons.prestashop.com/en/481-payment">payment methods</a> offered to PrestaShop customers. With <a href="http://addons.prestashop.com/en/payments-gateways-prestashop-modules/18752-brinkscheckout.html" target="_blank">Brinks Checkout</a>, customers can sell in almost 200 countries, accept 26 currencies and is offered in 15 languages – all with one merchant account. Consider the number of customers you can reach by adding just this tool. Check out their Addons page for more details on their offer then download their <a href="http://addons.prestashop.com/en/payments-gateways-prestashop-modules/18752-brinkscheckout.html" target="_blank">free module</a>.</p>
<p>BONUS: Use PrestaShop’s built-in localization features to translate your entire website to convert even more of your new international customer base. Simply navigate to your back office &gt; localization &gt; translations &gt; add / update a language.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-20944" alt="brinks_checkout" src="https://www.prestashop.com/blog/en/files/2015/12/brinks_checkout.png" width="155" height="55" /></p>
<h2 style="color:#01bad9">2. Enable international shipping options</h2>
<p>The second tool you’ll need to expand your business internationally in 2016 is a reliable and affordable way to transport your goods to the eventual customer. A few important things to consider are: shipping pricing and customs processing. You’ll need to figure out how much shipping a product overseas will cost you. Then you’ll need to decide if you want to charge your customers the entire shipping cost or if you want to offer competitive shipping prices and cover the remaining cost yourself. Keep in mind that some carriers tack on additional surcharges to deliver the package overseas.</p>
<p>Next, you should prepare the necessary information for shipping overseas. Customs declaration forms should generally accompany packages that weigh more than a pound. Depending on your carrier, you may need to detail each product, their components, weights as well as price. Be sure to have all this handy to expedite your shipping process. Once you’ve shipped to a new country, be sure to note the amount of time it takes to deliver your package.</p>

<h2 style="color:#01bad9">3. Meet new customers on marketplaces</h2>
<p>A great way to meet new potential customers is by listing your product on marketplaces like <a href="http://addons.prestashop.com/en/marketplace-prestashop-modules/2742-ebay.html" target="_blank">eBay</a>. You can choose to list your entire product catalog or just the most popular products. For customers who aren’t too familiar with your shop or brand, it’s a quick way to ease into purchasing from you. They can shop on a platform they are used to. The only difference is that this particular product is shipped by you. </p>
<p>Marketplaces are a great way for merchants looking to expand internationally to test out their target markets. Before making large investments into additional inventory for your new segment, listing your product on eBay can help you determine if there is even a need for that product in your target market.

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Whether you’ve just finished running a successful marketing campaign or have just come back from a successful event, chances are, you now have new leads for your shop. What’s next? Do you email them? What do you say? Today we’ll help you figure just what to do with them to improve your lead retention.<br />
<span id="more-20933"></span></p>
<h2>1. Qualify Leads</h2>
<p>The first step following lead acquisition is to qualify your leads. Where you did you acquire them from? Where are they currently in the purchase funnel? Three sample categories include: don&#8217;t know the brand, love the brand but haven&#8217;t purchased, new customer. By categorizing your leads, you’ll be able to craft a marketing message that is not only more relevant, but also engaging. </p>
<p>If customers just learned about your brand, they probably aren&#8217;t interested in all the updates you’ve made to an older version of your product. They don’t even know what your product was like before! Misaligned emails can also befuddle your existing customers. For example, sending an old customer a new campaign about your company might lead them to believe you’re changing your company. It’s why we highlight the importance of knowing exactly who you are talking to, so you can maximize the impact of the messages you send. </p>
<h2>2. Activation / Reactivation Campaign</h2>
<p>If you’re targeting those who don’t know your brand, your first step should be introducing them to what you sell. By aligning your message with the right audience, you increase the chances of retaining your customer longer. These activation campaigns aim to get customers interested in your brand and hopefully even engage your company. </p>
<p>If you’re leads are already customers, your goal is to get them to convert again, preferably in the form of a new purchase. If they purchased from you before, give them an incentive to make a purchase. As an added bonus for you, try to get feedback from customers by asking them to complete a survey. Once they provide feedback, they’ll be rewarded with a coupon to shop your site. </p>
<h2>3. Engagement Campaign</h2>
<p>Sometimes customers just aren’t ready to convert. Don&#8217;t discount these leads! Just because they haven’t made a purchase, it doesn’t mean they’re not interested in your business. Keep in touch with your customers by sending regular updates about your products or the latest trends in your industry. This is especially important during low sales seasons when other companies may not be engaging your customers.</p>
<p>Selling pet supplies? Touch base with pet lovers on days like National Dog Day or during <a href="http://www.dogtipper.com/fun/pet-holidays" target="_blank">related events</a> like <a href="http://www.crufts.org.uk/" target="_blank">Crufts</a>. It’s time to get creative to engage customers. There is no wrong or right approach, it’s all about building a relationship with your customers. </p>
<h2>4. Convert <a href="https://www.prestashop.com/blog/en/respond-customer-feedback-boost-business/" style="font-family: 'Roboto Condensed', Tahoma,Verdana,sans-serif;font-size:28px;font-weight: 300">Complaints</a> into Hot Leads</h2>
<p>Hearing from customers is always a good thing, even in the form of angry <a href="https://www.prestashop.com/blog/en/3-must-follow-rules-for-addressing-your-online-stores-customer-complaints/">customers complaining</a>. Every interaction or touch point of your brand is an opportunity to make a positive impact on your customers. If you can win them over when they are most upset with you, keeping them around will be a piece of cake. </p>
<p>First, listen carefully to customer concerns. They’re taking time to tell you about their problem, so give the courtesy of hearing them out. Stay objective by focusing on the facts and not on emotions. Next, try to find a resolution that works for both you and the customer. Try to deliver the solution in a timely fashion. For some examples and more tips on handling customer complaints, check out these ideas for <a href="https://www.prestashop.com/blog/en/respond-customer-feedback-boost-business/">how to respond to customer feedback</a>.</p>
<h2>5. Run personalized campaigns</h2>
<p>If you don’t have a new batch of hot leads, there’s still something you can do to re-engage your audience. Most merchants only target customers during major holidays sales, as the majority of people tend to shop at this time. However, there’s a way to keep customers engaged throughout the year, specifically, one special day of the year for each of your customer &#8211; their birthday!</p>
<p>Birthdays are spread throughout the year, so you can kick off this campaign at anytime. Birthdays are about the customer, not you &#8211; so tailor your messages with that in mind. Try messages built on the idea of a birthday gift. Whether you offer a special discount code (like “MYBIRTHDAY” or a birthday gift card, this gesture (although generic) has the ability to feel very personal. </p>
<h2>It’s your turn</h2>
<p>Use one or all of our building blocks to turn your leads from cold to hot and keep them coming back:</p>
<ol>
<li>Qualify your leads</li>
<li>Try activation or reactivation campaigns</li>
<li>Engage customers</li>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The holiday season is upon us. You’ve decked out your homepage, planned your holiday promotions and set up a targeted communication plan to draw a maximum number of shoppers. This is the biggest revenue-generating time of the year after all. But what if, despite your greatest efforts, you don’t see an uptick in sales by early December? Don’t worry, all hope is not lost. We’ve put together a few technical tips to help you determine what might be going wrong on your site and a few marketing actions to boost sales.<br />
<span id="more-20920"></span><br />
<strong>Check on site speed.</strong> This is a busy time of year and shoppers are less patient than usual (which isn’t saying much). If your site takes more than 3 seconds to load, this could explain why you’re losing shoppers before check out. Make sure photos are optimized for the web. Get in touch with your hosting provider to let them know you’re expecting an uptick in traffic and <a href="http://addons.prestashop.com/en/432-website-performance" target="_blank">make sure a simple technical glitch isn’t standing between you and out-of-the-park sales</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Identify problem pages.</strong> Use Google Analytics to identify 404 Error Pages that may be scaring away customers. Review your 404 Error message and make sure it’s reassuring, not cryptic and worrisome. Customers need to be assured they’re still on your site and not opening themselves up to viruses and malware.</p>
<p><strong>Verify your Adwords account.</strong> If you’re using paid advertising, double check your keywords, make sure everything is headed in the right direction. Since it’s the holidays, you might want to transfer budget to large cities that are commerce hubs, or specific customer segments. Just make sure everything is setup correctly, as a technical error could be what’s affecting your sales.</p>
<p><strong>Evaluate recent changes.</strong> If you’re not seeing traffic increase, or worse, you’re seeing a decrease during the holidays, take a minute to evaluate any changes you’ve made. You probably redid your homepage for the holidays and updated product pages. Did you overlook any important elements, like call to action buttons? Did you add complications to the sales funnel? Are your special offers and purchase triggers like free shipping clearly displayed on your site? Take time to analyze how your changes may have impacted traffic. </p>
<p><strong>Stay on top of suppliers.</strong> Ideally this is something you addressed before the holiday season got underway. If a main supplier encounters a problem that interrupts or slows production, that then becomes your problem. Try to diversify your suppliers so you’re not dependent on just one. This will keep you nimble during the holiday rush. Also, stay on top of your suppliers. Late deliveries could leave you with excess stock that could force you to take post-holiday markdowns.</p>
<p><strong>Update content.</strong> You should have holiday-themed blog posts up or ready to go. Have you embedded links back to your bestsellers in them? You should have. Review your homepage and product pages and spruce up content by adding synonyms and keywords customers are searching for. Consider creating or updating a gift guide. These simplify the shopping experience and let you put your bestsellers front and center. </p>
<p><strong>Reach out to local press.</strong> National print magazines have already moved on to planning January and February issues, but you might have a shot at getting some coverage in your local news outlets, which could give you added visibility when you need it.</p>
<p><strong>Get serious on social.</strong> Social media is a great tool to boost holiday sales. Try offering a social-media only promotion or holding a contest online. You’ll have to make your deals incredibly tempting, but if you’ve got low-performing inventory you want to move, consider bundling it into gifts or offering a giveaway with a certain purchase level.</p>
<p><strong>Have communication ready in case of unforeseen events.</strong> Some things are simply out of your control: no one expects you to stop snowstorms or strikes. However, they do expect you to troubleshoot and communicate. Have an email ready to send explaining that you’re doing your best to work around whatever incident has arisen. You’ll be able to fill in a few more details just before you send it. </p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The sales process used to be fairly simple, generating data that was easy to visualize and track. But ecommerce changed all that. Today, an online purchase generates a storm of data that can be used to improve sales performance—if you know how to harness it. Large companies have understood this and invest in exploiting that data. Small businesses can reap the benefits from this information as well, although they have to be a bit more nimble in doing so, given their limited human and financial resources. Here are a few ideas for how small businesses can go beyond simply monitoring data and turn it into a competitive advantage, especially for identifying actions during key sales periods.<br />
<span id="more-20912"></span></p>
<h2 style="color:#59bbc4">Identify patterns</h2>
<p>Finding patterns in data starts with monitoring activity, but it doesn’t end there. The key to making the most of data is to look for patterns: What are your customers buying? How are they finding it? Are they coming back? How much are they spending? Can you get them to spend more, and more often? </p>
<p>It helps to think of sales and marketing processes in terms of funnels. You might send 1,000 emails for a campaign that result in 10 recipients buying something. What happens along the way and why, is crucial to helping you determine what to change in your process in order to better respond to your customers. </p>
<p>Here’s an example of a typical email campaign funnel:</p>
<ol>
<li>You send 1,000 past customers an email promoting your holiday sale.</li>
<li>Of the 1,000 sent, 980 are delivered by your email service.</li>
<li>Of the 980 delivered, 325 are opened by past customers.</li>
<li>Of the 325 opened, 40 click on a product link in the email.</li>
<li>Of the 40 that clicked, 35 add a product to their shopping cart.</li>
<li>Of the 35 that add products to their shopping cart, 8 follow through with the purchase.</li>
</ol>
<p>Having data about each “narrowing” of the funnel helps you understand where problems may be occurring and where to focus your efforts and resources. </p>
<p>To a see a real shift in business requires consolidating the data gathered from monitoring, analyzing the results over time, and testing variations on strategy to see what happens. Any time is the perfect time to start gathering and analyzing data, but the holiday season is a particularly good time because it’s such a heavy-hitting time of year and ideally you’ll want to improve your performance each year. </p>
<h2 style="color:#59bbc4">Set goals</h2>
<p>It helps to have a goal in order to determine if what you’re doing is working and if it’s even right for your business. For example, are you trying to increase traffic? Boost sales? Reduce customer service calls? In order to test and monitor for these goals, you’ll want to establish a set of key performance indicators, or KPIs, to guide your analysis. Here are a few ideas to get you started thinking about what KPIs to focus on:</p>
<p><strong>Goal:</strong> Increase Site Traffic 25%<br />
<strong>KPIs:</strong> site traffic, sources, click-through rates, social shares, bounce rates. </p>
<p><strong>Goal:</strong> Increase Sales 10%<br />
<strong>KPIs:</strong> Daily sales, conversion rate, site traffic</p>
<p><strong>Goal:</strong> Increase conversions 5%<br />
<strong>KPIs:</strong> Conversion rate, shopping cart abandonment rate, competitive price trends. </p>
<h2 style="color:#59bbc4">Test your ideas</h2>
<p>Split testing is a small business owner’s best friend. Once you’ve decided what your goal is and what KPIs you’re going to focus on, you can start getting scientific about how you’re going to get there. Start by identifying different page layouts for product pages and split testing them to see what resonates most with your customers. You can do the same thing with email campaigns and social media projects. </p>
<p>Here are a few examples of things to test on your website: </p>
<ul style="padding-left: 30px">
<li>Product images</li>
<li>Product descriptions</li>
<li>Call to action button text</li>
<li>Call to action button position</li>
</ul>
<p>Google Trends is a great place to start identifying what’s relevant in your market via the volume and popularity of searches in your field. This can inform your business from a supply and demand perspective, but also give you ideas for content and specific wording to test throughout your site, email campaigns and social media actions.</p>
<h2 style="color:#59bbc4">Tools and resources</h2>
<p>You might be thinking, okay, monitoring and analyzing is great, but how do I manage all that information? Google Analytics is a great place to start. You can run your split tests through their “experiments” function to see which changes work and which don’t. The results are not always what you’d expect, which is why it’s so interesting to perform this kind of test. Having <a href="http://addons.prestashop.com/en/63-analytics-stats-prestashop-modules" target="_blank">all your data consolidated in one place</a> is also necessary if you’re going to draw any useful conclusions. </p>
<p>You should also think about how you’re going to divide your marketing budget between customer segments. While acquisition should be an important part of your marketing budget, returning customers are actually more valuable in the long run. They are more likely to refer your brand and draw viral attention to it. You can invest in them by sending simple gifts, getting in touch with them via phone or email, or following up with special offers or coupons. By dividing your customers into segments (returning and new) you can test these initiatives and see what spurs repeat spending and increased spending. </p>
<h2 style="color:#59bbc4">Social media</h2>
<p>Social media creates a lot of data, but it can be difficult to tell what is driving conversions and what is giving you longer term visibility without necessarily resulting in immediate conversions. Facebook Insights and a platform like Hootsuite for Twitter can help you get a handle on these numbers and evaluate your activities on social media. <a href="http://addons.prestashop.com/en/39-social-commerce-facebook-prestashop-modules" target="_blank">The PrestaShop Addons marketplace features a variety of modules</a> designed to give merchants insight into their marketing efforts, including on social media. </p>
<p>Data can be an incredible competitive advantage for small businesses that understand how to use it. Setting goals, identifying KPIs and regularly testing are the first steps to better data management. Resources like Google Trends, Google Analytics and social media tools like Hootsuite all provide free or low-cost ways to manage data, so there’s no reason to wait to start gathering and analyzing your data! </p>

<span id="more-20903"></span><br />
Online stores conversions depend on many factors. The most important factor in the complex approach to conversion optimization is to squeeze the most from each and every one of these factors, minimizing the losses. Why is it so important?

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In 2015, <a href="http://ow.ly/TCoYA" target="_blank">social media are an integral part of everyday life</a> for almost all (96%) marketing professionals, who use them for both personal and professional purposes. As a business, it is important to choose marketing channels such as social media that will provide you with the best results and good ROI.</p>
<p>Today, more and more small businesses are choosing social media over other marketing channels to help raise awareness of their brand, boost their sales and grow their professional network. Indeed, the figures for social media speak for themselves! Of the 3 billion people who use the Internet &#8211; i.e. 45% of the population &#8211; 2.1 billion have a social media account. There are 1.4 billion Facebook users and 248 million active Twitter users with 500 million tweets sent every day.*<br />
Another significant figure: the digital marketing budget of companies is expected to increase by 8% in 2015**.<br />
<span id="more-20883"></span><br />
But what about the things you <em>shouldn&#8217;t do</em>? Because make no mistake: some errors can be ruinous. Discover the 4 mistakes you absolutely must avoid when using social media for your business.</p>
<h2 style="color:#706da4">1. Not having a social media strategy</h2>
<p>Many companies start using social media without having guidelines or a strategy. Most importantly, lots of them have no idea of the stakes involved.</p>
<p>Why is this a mistake? Quite simply because every action taken on social media should correspond to a clear objective. If so, the rest of your social initiatives will be much easier to manage. If you don&#8217;t have a defined plan, these actions may not be clear or aligned with one another. The engagement of your subscribers and your ROI will be even more affected.</p>
<p>Does this seem complicated? Don&#8217;t worry! There are currently <a href="http://ow.ly/TCQ89" target="_blank">plans for creating social media strategies</a>. Think about your objectives, audit your social media sites, learn from the competition, <a href="http://ow.ly/TCQyP" target="_blank">create a content calendar</a> and lastly: test, test and test again in order to refine this strategy.</p>
<h2 style="color:#706da4">2. Buying &#8220;Likes&#8221; and subscribers</h2>
<p>On certain social media sites, you can buy &#8220;Likes&#8221; and subscribers. This technique was once widely used but is increasingly being criticized. Some brands prefer appealing to the “<a href="http://www.journaldunet.com/ebusiness/expert/57443/3-raisons-de-ne-pas-acheter-des-fans-facebook.shtml" target="_blank">social masses</a>”  but keep in mind that these fake &#8220;Likes&#8221; and phantom subscribers will have absolutely no impact on your results and will merely cause you to spend money. More importantly, the quality and interaction of your audience will decrease, your brand&#8217;s image will be tarnished and your ROI will be close to 0. If you want more interaction and subscribers, go with traditional solutions: word of mouth, competitions, contests, advertising, etc.</p>
<h2 style="color:#706da4">3. Posting too much content</h2>
<p>Posting content is a good strategy: it creates interaction in your accounts and provides your subscribers with information to which they will be receptive. However, if you post content too often, you may bore them in spite of their loyalty. You aren&#8217;t the only brand they follow and they won&#8217;t want or have time to digest this flow of information. In short, by posting too much content, you risk &#8220;spamming&#8221; your followers and therefore seeing them unsubscribe.</p>
<p>To avoid this mistake, create a <a href="http://ow.ly/TCQyP" target="_blank">content calendar</a> and stick to it. Be sure to post interesting and varied content that corresponds to the objective set for each social media site. Just the right amount of high-quality content is essential to the success of your social media strategy</p>
<h2 style="color:#706da4">4. Deleting negative comments</h2>
<p>The first reflex of beginners on social media sites is to delete injurious comments. Why leave such negative testimonials where everyone can see them? They&#8217;re sure to discredit you and directly affect your brand image. But think again: deleting them would be a big mistake! By doing so, you are showing everyone your guilt, sensitivity and lack of transparency. Consider these negative comments to be an opportunity: you can address them by satisfying an unhappy customer or solving a problem you might not even have been aware of, all while remaining in the public sphere. You will thus show everyone that you are professional and responsive. Even better: you can reply to these comments with some humor and thus turn the conversation to your advantage.</p>
<p>There are many other <a href="http://ow.ly/TCQLB" target="_blank">common strategic social media mistakes</a>, each one of which has a solution. What&#8217;s most important is that you have a strategy for your social media and know how to apply it. Of course, it&#8217;s easier to fall into traps when you&#8217;re just getting started on social media or are creating a new business and starting from scratch, but as the saying goes: &#8220;<em>don&#8217;t be afraid to make mistakes. Just don&#8217;t make the same mistake twice.</em>”</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Black Friday and Cyber Monday are coming up fast. We&#8217;ve put together a few stock management and merchandising tips to make sure you get the most out of the big weekend.<br />
<span id="more-20863"></span></p>
<h2 style="color: #846060;">Stock up</h2>
<p>Before you do anything else, stop and check your inventory! There&#8217;s nothing worse than running out of bestselling products in the middle of the holiday heyday. If you sell through marketplaces like Amazon as well, don&#8217;t underestimate how much you&#8217;re likely to sell. This is probably the one time when overstocking is not a bad thing.</p>
<p>When considering what to order and how much, ask yourself the following questions:</p>
<ul style="padding-left:30px">
<li>What sold well last year?</li>
<li>What did you run out of?</li>
<li>What did you hope to sell more of?</li>
</ul>
<h2 style="color: #846060;">Get ready for the rush</h2>
<p>Next, think about traffic and capacity. Is your site optimized to handle the holiday rush? Is your stock management system up to date and accurate—in other words, do you know how many products you actually have?</p>
<p>Once you&#8217;ve stocked up and made sure your site is ready to handle the holiday rush, double check your fulfillment process to be sure you meet shipping dates and get gifts to customers on time. Post shipping dates clearly on your website so there&#8217;s no confusion.</p>
<p>Finally, don&#8217;t skimp on security. This is definitely not the time for a security breach, with the increase of customers sharing their private information as they make purchases on your site. It&#8217;s a good idea to let your payment processor know you expect increased visits.</p>
<h2 style="color: #846060;">Stand out from the crowd</h2>
<p>Everyone is competing for attention at the holidays, and with good reason: the holiday season can bring in up to 30% of revenue for online merchants, in some cases up to 50%! With so many stores counting on great sales, customers are going to be facing an avalanche of promotions. Make sure you stand out from the crowd with <strong>highly-targeted, unique</strong> content.</p>
<p>Everyone will be advertising their sales and promotions in email subject titles, so consider another approach, like humor, to stand out. If that&#8217;s not your style, try crafting your titles to speak to your target segments, especially top customers. Put all the data you&#8217;ve collected over the last year to work for you to personalize emails and aggressively retarget key customer segments.</p>
<h2 style="color: #846060;">Guide your customers to the perfect gift</h2>
<p>Customers will be cramming as much shopping in on Black Friday and Cyber Monday as they can. Make it easy for them to find what they need on your site by putting together gift guides that address different customer types, like moms and dads, or product categories, like stocking stuffers or winter duds.</p>
<h2 style="color: #846060;">Throw in free shipping</h2>
<p>Customers love a good deal this time of the year, but they love free shipping even more. In fact, shipping fees contribute more than anything else to abandoned carts. This might seem like a big investment for small businesses, but the fact is, shipping fees could be what turn customers away from your site and to the competition.</p>
<p>To take some of the risk out of offering free shipping, ask yourself a few questions to optimize the shipping process:</p>
<ul style="padding-left:30px">
<li>How many customers didn&#8217;t receive their order on time?</li>
<li>How did our partners perform?</li>
<li>What was the most popular shipping option?</li>
<li>Were my shipping cut-off dates accurate enough for domestic and international customers?</li>
<li>What were my fulfilment and shipping costs?</li>
</ul>
<h2 style="color: #846060;">Don&#8217;t forget your &#8220;404 Page Not Found&#8221; and &#8220;No Results Found&#8221; pages</h2>
<p>Customer searches may turn up negative for a variety reasons, from spelling errors to different regional names for the same product. Don&#8217;t lose customers by dead-ending them at an error page. Optimize these pages by suggesting similar products or displaying a page of bestsellers.</p>
<h2 style="color: #846060;">Take our Black Friday/Cyber Monday survey!</h2>
<p>Black Friday and Cyber Monday generate incredible sales in the United States, but their impact in other countries varies: do merchants practice Black Friday and Cyber Monday sales in Europe? Do South American customers expect extreme deals at this time of year? What about Asia?</p>
<p>To understand how these key dates impact PrestaShop merchants not only in the US but around the world, we&#8217;ve put together a survey and we&#8217;d love it if you&#8217;d participate! We&#8217;ll share the results in an update to this article and on social media.</p>
